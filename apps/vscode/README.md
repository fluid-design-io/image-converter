## ‚ú® Features

-   **Compress Images**: Quickly compress various image formats (`JPEG`, `PNG`, `WebP`, `AVIF`, `TIFF`, `GIF`).
-   **Format Conversion**: Convert images to modern formats like `WebP` or `AVIF` to optimize for web performance.
-   **Interactive Mode**: Fine-tune compression settings like `quality`, `format`, and `max-width` for each operation.
-   **Batch Processing**: Compress multiple images or entire folders at once.
-   **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click on files or folders in the explorer to start compressing.

## üöÄ Usage

All commands are available from the File Explorer context menu.

### Compress with Default Settings

1.  In the VS Code Explorer, **right-click an image file** (or select multiple files and right-click).
2.  Select **Compress Images** from the context menu.
3.  The images will be compressed using your configured default settings.

### Interactive Compression

For more control over the output:

1.  **Right-click your image(s)** and select **Compress Images with Options...**.
2.  You'll be prompted to enter:

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The extension is built with a simple and effective architecture:

-   **`index.ts`**: The main entry point that registers commands and handles user interactions (UI prompts, progress notifications). It uses `reactive-vscode` for clean, declarative command registration.
-   **`image-processor.ts`**: This is the core of the extension. It uses the **sharp** library to handle all image manipulation tasks. It's designed to be efficient, performing operations on buffers to minimize disk I/O and running compressions concurrently.
-   **`package.json`**: Defines the extension's metadata, commands, configuration options, and activation events. It's configured to activate the extension only when an image-related command is triggered, ensuring minimal impact on startup performance.
-   **`utils.ts` / `config.ts`**: Helper files for logging, size formatting, and managing configuration, keeping the main logic clean and focused.
